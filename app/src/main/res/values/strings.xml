    <string name="random_big_text">The new option would allow Tesla to deliver its
        least expensive Model 3 cars more quickly,
        at a penalty of just 10 miles on EPA range ratings:
        253 miles vs 263 miles—for the same sticker price.
        In turn, it could presumably shift more of its traditional
        battery packs to the hot-selling Model Y compact crossover.</string>
